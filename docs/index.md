# NumType documentation

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various
derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of
routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape
manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear
algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.
